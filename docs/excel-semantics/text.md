# Text

## Broadcast text output cap
Rule: a text function broadcast over arrays (LEFT, REPT, SUBSTITUTE, ...) returns a single scalar `#VALUE!` (no spill) once the total bytes of its string results exceed 64 MiB, to bound allocation on untrusted input (CLAUDE.md directive 5). Excel's behavior (expected, not measured): compute the whole array, limited only by memory and the 32,767-char per-cell limit. Ours differs on legitimate data too: the budget counts UTF-8 bytes (not Excel's UTF-16 characters, so CJK text hits it about 3x sooner in characters), and a full-column text formula such as `=UPPER(A:A)` over ~65-char strings exceeds 64 MiB and returns `#VALUE!` where Excel spills normally.
Evidence: none for Excel's behavior; this is a resource limit, not an Excel observation.

## Text functions broadcast over array arguments
Rule: EXACT, FIND, LEN, REPT, SEARCH, SUBSTITUTE, TRIM, CLEAN, PROPER and REPLACE lift element-wise over
array and range arguments and spill, in any argument position (`REPT("a",{1,2,3})` = a, aa, aaa;
`SUBSTITUTE("aaa","a","x",{1,2,3})` = xaa, axa, aax; `REPLACE("abcdef",{1,2},{2,3},"Q")` = Qcdef, aQef;
`EXACT({"a","b"},{"a";"b"})` is a 2x2 grid). An element that errors is an error only in its own cell
(`FIND({"b","z"},"abc")` = 2, `#VALUE!`). Array constants may not contain expressions: Excel rejects the
whole workbook for `{"a"&CHAR(7)&"b","c"}` (use a range).

Status: VERIFIED (the engine matches all 58 cells)

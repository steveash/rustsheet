# Formula syntax

## IF needs at least two arguments
Rule: `=IF(x)` (one argument) is not a valid formula in Excel; `value_if_true` is required. A workbook whose formula text contains a one-argument `IF` is
rejected on load by Excel for the web, the whole workbook, not just that cell. The generator's
catalog therefore marks `value_if_true` as required (`eval/catalog/functions.yaml`, checked by
`tools/tests/test_catalog_arity.py`).
Evidence: single-cell workbooks sent with `rustsheet-oracle recalc -b excel-graph` on 2026-10-05:
`{"sheets":[{"name":"Sheet1","cells":{"A1":"=IF(TRUE)"}}]}` → createSession 501
`FileCorruptTryRepair`; the same with `=IF(TRUE,1)` loads and calculates. Re-run those two specs to
reproduce (rejected inputs cannot be cached or committed). Found in T-0203, where every gen-m2
workbook from the old catalog was refused; bisecting one isolated
`=MIN(ROUND(LEN(Data!$B5),6),IF(IFERROR(Data!C10,Data!$B3)),YEAR(59343))`.

## Goal
bfrac's continued-fraction arithmetic is modelled as Excel evaluates it.

## Context
- Split from T-3468 (size; one task per open item), itself split from T-3383 and T-2512. T-3383 pinned the density's
  lnB at min < 1 < 8 < max on 156 of 160 shapes (docs/research/t2464/r4-algdiv/RESULTS.md). Work in
  docs/research/t2464/ in a new `r5-*` directory, importing r2-bratio's `bratio_excel.py`, r2-tdist's `xlk.py`,
  r3-bgrat's `data.py`/`bscore.py` and r4-algdiv's `scan.py`. Method: docs/research/excel-kernel-playbook.md.
- Rules: positive controls before trusting a method; a real hold-out; record negatives (decision 0056); truncate
  formula literals to 15 digits as Excel does.
- **bfrac's fraction arithmetic.** The residual is white, with sd 3.8 units at (100, 120). Try the original Fortran
  BFRAC compiled for x87, and the per-iteration quantities (w4-fractions section 7).

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] A RESULTS.md records a model with exact, within-4-ulp and within-15-digit counts on a held-out probe, or the
      negatives tried with their counts.
- [ ] New oracle probes are committed under eval/suites/probes-numeric/cases/ with their sidecars.
- [ ] statistics.md's T-2464 entries are updated with what is found.
- [ ] Engine follow-ups are filed for any solved piece, or the owning engine task's criteria are amended.
- [ ] `make check` green; reviewers approve.

## Out of scope
- Engine changes (T-3382 ports the L140 one-term composition).
- The other items split from T-3468: T-3567 (bgrat increment, F at df 1), T-3568 (bup), T-3569 (algdiv), T-3570
  (bpser's lnGamma and b < 1 ceiling), T-3571 (bfrac), T-3572 (GAMMA.DIST near P = 1); one each.

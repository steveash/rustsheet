# Status

The steward routine owns the snapshot and the critical-lane line and rewrites them daily; agents may
still add or remove "Needs owner" entries. PRs no longer append log lines (decision 0024): the record
of merged work is `git log --first-parent main` plus each task's Outcome, and the steward lists what
merged since its last run.

**Progress dashboard:** [docs/progress.md](progress.md), regenerated daily by the steward.

## Snapshot — 2026-10-26 (M2 is current)

This is the scheduled run at 05:47 UTC. It follows #1848 and covers the 56 commits merged to `main` since then, through e1d70c77.

`make eval` ran on 00736b98 (engine code identical to `main` at e0277f77), so the dashboard and visible-parity lock predate #1738 and #1894.
- All 17 suites were fetched and scored. The first pass skipped calipers, corpus-bench and poi because they had not been fetched; I fetched them and re-ran. Timeouts: 0 in every suite.
- `make eval-lower-visible-lock` shows 0 regressions in every gated suite and lowers the visible-parity lock from 4,640 to 4,348 (decision 0093).
- The dashboard has today's numbers (`make progress-report`; the judgment blocks pass `--check`).

CI on `main` is green through e0277f77. Since #1848 there were 55 push runs: 39 green, 16 cancelled by the next push, and none failed.

**M2 is still current: M0–M2 probes (decision 0051) have 9 known failures, 2 of them visibly off.**
- `probes/t2723-unary-plus-formula-text` S!C24 and S!C25 (FORMULATEXT keeps a space after a unary plus) are the 2 visibly-off cells. Owner: T-2769 (engine, M2), claimed by `agent/engine/T-2769-unary-plus-space`.
- `probes/t2756-roundup-smallest-normal-threshold` Sheet1!A52–A58 (ROUNDUP's subnormal cut) are within 15 digits but not bit-exact. Owner: T-2771 (research, M2).
- T-2723 (#1833) and T-2756 (#1887) merged since the last run and fixed S!B14, S!B15 and t2715.
- The frozen M1 list has 0 known failures (89/89 cases).
- `make exit-owners MILESTONE=M2` still cannot run, because report.json has exit rows for M5 and M6 only. The planner checked M2 by hand and filed nothing. `make exit-owners MILESTONE=M5` reports 0 unowned.

Hygiene:
- lint-debt: 91 allow entries (= last run);
- duplicated lines: 2,951 (= last run);
- oversized files: 8 (was 9). financial_bonds.rs is no longer oversized. `check_file_size.py` only notes this, and I didn't commit the `--update`: quality/ is a protected path, and the governance gate wants a decision record for it.

Merged since #1848: 56 commits through e1d70c77. None was reverted, and all came through PRs.
- #1872 (T-2551) and #1876 (T-1966) were squash-merged without the `(#n)` suffix in the title.
- Task ids merged (52): T-0068–T-0076, T-0080, T-0081, T-0472, T-1734, T-1738, T-1922, T-1961, T-1966, T-2102, T-2290, T-2302, T-2470, T-2471, T-2474, T-2524, T-2534, T-2542, T-2543, T-2551, T-2573, T-2576, T-2577, T-2596, T-2610, T-2620, T-2640, T-2643, T-2688, T-2706, T-2709, T-2710, T-2715, T-2723, T-2737–T-2740, T-2743, T-2750, T-2751, T-2754, T-2756, T-2761.
- Task-only PRs: #1845, #1870, #1879.

Blocked: 33 (34 last run, counted by front matter).
- New: T-2774, IMTAN of a real number. It is a web-vs-desktop conflict on IMTAN(5) and waits on T-1075.
- Unblocked: T-1592 (todo again). T-0076 is done.

Open PRs: 11 at 06:30 UTC. Three non-draft agent PRs were older than 24 h. I re-ran every applicable reviewer on each one's diff (decision 0050).
- **#1738 (T-1734, two-condition number-format sections)**: all four reviewers returned APPROVE. Their minor nits are style only, and the unprobed edges are T-2768. I merged `main` in under the merge lock (clean; tasks and decisions validate). CI was green on ee5421bd and the branch was up to date, so I **merged** it as cf09ecb5.
- **#1727 (T-2622)**: not merged. reviewer-architecture, reviewer-quality and reviewer-excel-fidelity returned REQUEST_CHANGES. statistics.md cites `DataError::AfterScalars` / `percentile_numbers` as the implementation, but no such code exists after the branch's merge of `main`. lookup.md credits this PR with XMATCH code it doesn't touch. COUNT and COUNTA duplicate their `CELL("contents")` walk. I commented the blocker on the PR.
- **#1718 (T-2427)**: not merged. reviewer-excel-fidelity returned REQUEST_CHANGES. Bins-array error elements now propagate with no oracle evidence, and corpus-bench/53062 (T-2636) points the other way. A data-range error now loses to a scalar bins error, which is unprobed. I commented the blocker on the PR.
- #1583 (T-2398) and #1658 (T-2131) are still drafts whose tasks are blocked. #1767 (T-0972) is a draft too.
- #1769 (T-2504) passes 24 h at 07:27 UTC.
- No duplicates. No task is `Blocked because: review-round limit`.

Queues:
- `make ready-tasks LANE=functions` printed 116 ready, so the gap-triager did not run. `TIER=sonnet` printed 67 (≥ 10).
- engine and research print 0 ready because their M2 work is owned and in flight. The planner ran for M2 and filed nothing.

Upstream IronCalc: no new commits under base/, xlsx/ or bindings/python since the last triaged commit.

Oracle: excel-graph credentials are present.
- probes: 0 written, 1 failure. `typed-if-one-argument` (T-1990) still gets 501 `FileCorruptTryRepair`. The other 2 pending cases are the unfillable M10 locale cases.
- ironcalc-calc's 1 pending case is Excel-authored, and poi's 205 are web-vs-desktop conflicts (decision 0019), so neither was refilled.

Spot-audit: the last was 2026-10-25 (#1736), so none is due. The next is on or after 2026-11-01.

**Critical lane:** engine, research

(Ordered list read by both tier workers, which then fall back to `functions`. The current milestone is M2.
- engine: T-2769, the 2 visibly-off M0–M2 cells (S!C24, S!C25); it is in flight.
- research: T-2771, the last M0–M2 known failures (A52–A58, bit-level).
- harness has M2 generator-pool tasks but no M2 exit work. api and quality have no M2 work. perf stays out: Phase 2.)

## Needs owner

- **Direct pushes to `main`** (2026-10-18, continuing 2026-10-19). Session `01Xbmds2…` has now pushed fifteen T-1778 commits straight to `main` with no PR (6f85cc9 … 892a53ca reported last run; fc3f993d, c00142bb, 0b5ce7a4, 36217c63, 756f849f, 37d303dd, 32ac084d and c763916b since), so the reviewer agents never saw them. CI passed on each and nothing needs reverting. New this run: **32ac084d edits a protected path, `.claude/skills/excel-probe/SKILL.md`**, without the decision record the governance gate demands of a PR. It is a two-line pointer to the new `docs/research/excel-kernel-playbook.md`, and both read as benign research guidance. Still, agent instructions changed with no review. Recommended fix: a branch ruleset on `main` that requires a pull request (the steward and workers already merge through PRs, so nothing changes for them). If these pushes were your own interactive work, remove this item. Update 2026-10-20: no direct push to `main` since the last run; all 109 commits came through PRs. Update 2026-10-25: still none; all 221 commits since 2026-10-22 came through PRs, and so did the 81 since #1736.
- **Missed steward runs** (2026-10-25). There is no steward snapshot or PR for 2026-10-23 or 2026-10-24, so this snapshot covers three days. Please check that the daily steward routine fired on those days. Update (second 2026-10-25 run): a scheduled steward firing ran today at 18:47 UTC. SPEC-0022 notes that #1736 was probably not a scheduled run. Update 2026-10-26: the scheduled run fired again at 05:47 UTC.

excel-desktop needs are not owner items (decision 0039): T-1016, T-1051 and the other desktop tasks wait in M14 (Phase 4), tracked by T-1074 and T-1075.

T-0106/7/8/10 now ready.
- 2026-10-04 — Owner updated the routine prompts to the text in `docs/process/routines.md` (verified identical). Decision 0014: Excel is always right; every quirk found is recorded in docs/excel-semantics/.
- 2026-10-04 — T-0013 (+ T-0010): every oracle workbook carries an embedded canary (poisoned cached values) and is refused unless Excel recalculated it; canary exposed that Excel-authored workbooks were never saved by the Graph session (old flow returned cached values) — fixed with a post-calculate no-trace edit; Graph calls retry dropped connections (T-0010); eval delta none
- 2026-10-04 — T-0004 (partial): smoke oracle-filled (canary-verified); Excel disproved D-function criteria trimming (engine fixed, criteria.md entry); eval now lets oracle values replace hand values keyed without sheet quotes; smoke 38/38 vs Excel, 0 regressions
- 2026-10-04 — Owner review: filed T-0016..T-0023, T-0402 (model tiers, board conflicts, task ids, milestone-order triage, POI oracle fill, evidence coverage, fuzzing, reviewer models, perf gate); T-0203 and T-0004 raised to P0; critical lane engine, harness, research, perf (API v0 done, api lane empty).
- 2026-10-04 — T-0022: security/architecture/quality reviewers on Sonnet, fidelity/performance pinned to Opus (decision 0015); eval delta none.

- 2026-10-04 — T-0023: tasks carry `tier: sonnet | opus`; sonnet (hourly) and opus (2-hourly) workers replace the lane workers; stuck sonnet runs hand off (decision 0018). Needs owner: re-apply docs/process/routines.md. Eval delta none.
- 2026-10-04 — T-0004 done: oracle calibration over ironcalc-calc (71,765 cells, 99.96% bit-exact; 7 day-first-locale cached cells, 4 web-vs-desktop INDIRECT, 18 last-digit float); canary pins en-US; probes/date-text-locale added (probes known failures 13 -> 18, new coverage); filed T-0024
- 2026-10-04 — T-0108: Excel 1900 leap-year serials in DATE/DAY/MONTH/YEAR/formatting; probes known failures 18 -> 15 (A1-A3 fixed), ironcalc-calc 1578 -> 1578, 0 regressions; filed T-0125
- 2026-10-04 — T-0108 follow-up: added probes/dates-early-1900 (oracle-filled, 16 cells, 4 known failures -> T-0125); fixed EOMONTH early serials and DATE(1900,1,0)
- 2026-10-04 — T-0019: excel-graph sidecars for 40 POI workbooks (`oracle_dir`, committed in eval/suites/poi/oracle); poi pending 237 -> 198, known failures 647 -> 959 (new coverage, 0 regressions; 257 web-vs-desktop conflicts left pending, decision 0019); harness now parses JSON floats exactly (serde_json `float_roundtrip`; oracle values had read 1 ulp off, probes-numeric 60.19% -> 68.08%); quirk: SIN/COS at multiples of 90°.
- 2026-10-04 — T-0206: probes/criteria-operands oracle-filled (25 cells); fixed <,>,<=,>= with boolean/error operands and D-function explicit '=' exactness; 0 regressions, probes 25/25 new cells pass
- 2026-10-05 — T-0028: agents check PR mergeability after every push, event and merge to main, and resolve conflicts at once (decision 0020); `make check` runs typos; eval delta none.
- 2026-10-05 — T-0015: spec2xlsx output deterministic (pinned core.xml creation time); eval delta none.
- 2026-10-05 — T-0027: shared-formula members shown shifted in eval show/snapshot (engine `shift_formula_text`); eval delta none.
- 2026-10-05 — T-0203: gen-m2 oracle-filled and gated (30 cases, 12,000 cells, 85.62% bit-exact, 1,726 known failures, new coverage); IF arity fixed in the catalog; T-0208 fixed (oracle `#SPILL!` read by key name; 74 cells); 14 gap tasks T-0209..T-0222; unknown rich errorTypes read as `#UNDECODED!` and stay unscored (poi 951 -> 950, T-0030).
- 2026-10-05 — T-0123: names may contain `\` (en-US lexer, identifier validity); poi known failures 950 -> 935 (15 fixed, 0 regressions).
- 2026-10-05 — T-0031: salvaged stale draft PRs #11/#13/#38 (T-0905, T-0907 restored; financial.md; T-0901/T-0925 findings) and closed them; eval delta none.
- 2026-10-05 — Log frozen here (decision 0024, T-0033); later work: `git log --first-parent main` and the steward's daily summary.
- 2026-10-05 — Owner re-applied the T-0023 routines (sonnet hourly, opus every 2 h); T-0032: sonnet queue buffer (≥10 ready sonnet tasks; `make ready-tasks`, decision 0021).

# Status

The steward routine owns the snapshot and the critical-lane line and rewrites them daily; agents may
still add or remove "Needs owner" entries. PRs no longer append log lines (decision 0024): the record
of merged work is `git log --first-parent main` plus each task's Outcome, and the steward lists what
merged since its last run.

## Snapshot — 2026-10-08 (M1 in progress)

| Suite | Cases | Cells | Bit-exact | Known failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ironcalc-calc | 214 | 72,197 | 97.84% | 1,558 |
| poi | 336 | 27,290 | 97.96% (204 cases pending: no formulas, unreadable, or web-vs-desktop conflicts) | 572 |
| gen-m2 | 30 | 12,000 | 99.61% | 47 |
| gen-m1 | 15 | 3,750 | 99.79% (M1 exit needs 100%; 8 cells left, all last-digit) | 8 |
| probes | 267 | 8,641 | 97.12% | 252 |
| smoke | 6 | 46 | 100% | 0 |
| fixtures | 4 | 37 | 62.16% (T-0278 fixture, new coverage) | 14 |
| probes-numeric | 27 | 10,129 | 51.43% | not gated |

`make eval` on `main` (bccce59). `eval-check` shows 0 regressions in every suite. CI on `main` (bccce59) is green.
Probes known failures rose 192 → 252 with 135 new probe cases (new coverage, not regressions).

Hygiene: lint-debt 99 allow entries · duplicated lines 7,158 (ratchet file still 7,323) · oversized files 16 (ratchet file still lists 18; `text/common.rs` and `math_and_trigonometry/mathematical.rs` are now under the limit).
`quality/` is protected, so the next PR that touches it records the drops.

Since the 2026-10-07 snapshot (108315e), 50 PRs merged to `main` through bccce59, all tasks, and none was reverted:
T-0049/0052, T-0110, T-0165/0180/0183, T-0223, T-0261/0262/0263/0267, T-0274/0275/0277/0279/0280/0281/0284,
T-0935/0952/0984, T-1004/1005/1006/1008/1010/1011/1017, T-1040/1041/1050/1059,
T-1107–T-1109, T-1111–T-1116, T-1118–T-1122, T-1125–T-1128. T-1132 (#372) and T-0191 (#371, deviation scoring) merged during this run, after the eval above.
Blocked (12): the Phase 2 tasks T-0400/T-0401/T-0402 and T-1066 (decision 0027); T-1099 (GEOMEAN last ulp);
the M14 desktop-oracle tasks T-0171, T-0198, T-1016, T-1051, T-1074, T-1075, T-1081 (decision 0039).
T-1100 is blocked on its branch (#314, draft).

**Nightly fuzz is red, with two real findings.** The T-1067 build fix works: run 37724893331 (2026-10-08, b38d244) fuzzed, and two of three targets failed.
- `formula_eval` ran out of memory on `OR(IFERROR(ERROR.TYPE(TRUNC($Z$1))=5,F:LSE))`. OR walks every cell of the 8,606 whole columns and memory grows per empty cell (`OR(F:AZ)`: 23 s, 4.3 GB). This is T-0230, now P0 and moved to `functions-logic`.
- `xlsx_import` panicked on an unmutated seed, `fixtures/ifs-legacy-range-criteria.xlsx`. Its legacy `COUNTIFS(A1:A6,D1:D2)` hits the debug_assert "Larger-than-1x1 array reached scalar-context cell" (`model.rs:984`). This is T-0278, now P0.
- Both were reproduced locally on bccce59. Each task now carries the reproducer, and its unit test is an acceptance criterion (decision 0035).
- `formula_parse` passed its 20 minutes.

Open PRs at the start of the run: 5, none older than 24 h, so none needed steward action.
- #370 (T-1013, draft, handed off to opus) is under 1 h old. #371 (T-0191) merged during this run.
- #330 (T-0411) is about 10 h old.
- #312 (T-1079) and #314 (T-1100, draft, blocked) are about 15 h old.
- #203, #129 and #105 from the last run are closed. T-0040 is done.

T-0163's claim branch has had no commit since 2026-10-07 08:27, so workers will resume it.

Queues at the start of the run:
- functions: 36 ready. The sonnet buffer is 19. research 13, quality 6, perf 5 (Phase 2).
- engine and harness: 0 ready only because both lanes are busy. They have 15 and 5 unclaimed M1 todo tasks (harness 4 after T-0191 merged).
- research has 1 M1 todo task and api has only the claimed T-0163, so the planner ran for M1 research and filed T-1137–T-1140 (sonnet probes). It filed no api tasks: no M1 api scope is left.
- The gap-triager did not run: functions has 36 ready, and the sonnet buffer is at least 10.

Upstream IronCalc: 3 new commits past 09e81f53, now triaged through 106c587d.
- 753da658 and 03beb38e (spaces around DATEVALUE/TIMEVALUE separators) and 106c587d (DATEVALUE rolls over at 24:00) became T-1136 (functions-date, sonnet).
- TIMEVALUE spacing and the space-separated 24:00 rollover already match. Spaced DATEVALUE forms and `T24:00:00` do not.

Oracle: excel-graph OK. The fill on ironcalc-calc wrote 0 sidecars (211 skipped). The fill on poi wrote 0 (292 skipped, the same 4 workbook failures as T-0019).

Spot-audit: none yet. The first weekly audit is due 2026-10-09.

**Critical lane:** engine, harness, research, api

(Ordered list read by both tier workers, which then fall back to `functions`.
- M1 exit needs gen-m1 at 100% (8 last-digit cells left) and probes at 100% (252 known failures before T-0191; accepted deviations now score in their own column).
- engine holds the parity work.
- harness has 4 M1 todo tasks (T-1014, T-1036, T-1096, T-1133). T-0191, the deviation scoring that M1 exit is measured with, merged during this run.
- research holds the probes that settle open questions. api holds only T-0163.
- The two fuzz P0s are in `functions-logic` and `functions-criteria`, which workers reach through `functions` (P0 first). perf stays out: Phase 2.)

## Needs owner

None. T-0040 (function catalog) is done. excel-desktop needs are not owner items (decision 0039): T-1016, T-1051 and the other desktop tasks wait in M14 (Phase 4), tracked by T-1074 and T-1075.

T-0106/7/8/10 now ready.
- 2026-10-04 — Owner updated the routine prompts to the text in `docs/process/routines.md` (verified identical). Decision 0014: Excel is always right; every quirk found is recorded in docs/excel-semantics/.
- 2026-10-04 — T-0013 (+ T-0010): every oracle workbook carries an embedded canary (poisoned cached values) and is refused unless Excel recalculated it; canary exposed that Excel-authored workbooks were never saved by the Graph session (old flow returned cached values) — fixed with a post-calculate no-trace edit; Graph calls retry dropped connections (T-0010); eval delta none
- 2026-10-04 — T-0004 (partial): smoke oracle-filled (canary-verified); Excel disproved D-function criteria trimming (engine fixed, criteria.md entry); eval now lets oracle values replace hand values keyed without sheet quotes; smoke 38/38 vs Excel, 0 regressions
- 2026-10-04 — Owner review: filed T-0016..T-0023, T-0402 (model tiers, board conflicts, task ids, milestone-order triage, POI oracle fill, evidence coverage, fuzzing, reviewer models, perf gate); T-0203 and T-0004 raised to P0; critical lane engine, harness, research, perf (API v0 done, api lane empty).
- 2026-10-04 — T-0022: security/architecture/quality reviewers on Sonnet, fidelity/performance pinned to Opus (decision 0015); eval delta none.

- 2026-10-04 — T-0023: tasks carry `tier: sonnet | opus`; sonnet (hourly) and opus (2-hourly) workers replace the lane workers; stuck sonnet runs hand off (decision 0018). Needs owner: re-apply docs/process/routines.md. Eval delta none.
- 2026-10-04 — T-0004 done: oracle calibration over ironcalc-calc (71,765 cells, 99.96% bit-exact; 7 day-first-locale cached cells, 4 web-vs-desktop INDIRECT, 18 last-digit float); canary pins en-US; probes/date-text-locale added (probes known failures 13 -> 18, new coverage); filed T-0024

- 2026-10-04 — T-0019: excel-graph sidecars for 40 POI workbooks (`oracle_dir`, committed in eval/suites/poi/oracle); poi pending 237 -> 198, known failures 647 -> 959 (new coverage, 0 regressions; 257 web-vs-desktop conflicts left pending, decision 0019); harness now parses JSON floats exactly (serde_json `float_roundtrip`; oracle values had read 1 ulp off, probes-numeric 60.19% -> 68.08%); quirk: SIN/COS at multiples of 90°.
- 2026-10-04 — T-0206: probes/criteria-operands oracle-filled (25 cells); fixed <,>,<=,>= with boolean/error operands and D-function explicit '=' exactness; 0 regressions, probes 25/25 new cells pass
- 2026-10-05 — T-0028: agents check PR mergeability after every push, event and merge to main, and resolve conflicts at once (decision 0020); `make check` runs typos; eval delta none.
- 2026-10-05 — T-0015: spec2xlsx output deterministic (pinned core.xml creation time); eval delta none.
- 2026-10-05 — T-0027: shared-formula members shown shifted in eval show/snapshot (engine `shift_formula_text`); eval delta none.
- 2026-10-05 — T-0203: gen-m2 oracle-filled and gated (30 cases, 12,000 cells, 85.62% bit-exact, 1,726 known failures, new coverage); IF arity fixed in the catalog; T-0208 fixed (oracle `#SPILL!` read by key name; 74 cells); 14 gap tasks T-0209..T-0222; unknown rich errorTypes read as `#UNDECODED!` and stay unscored (poi 951 -> 950, T-0030).
- 2026-10-05 — T-0123: names may contain `\` (en-US lexer, identifier validity); poi known failures 950 -> 935 (15 fixed, 0 regressions).
- 2026-10-05 — T-0031: salvaged stale draft PRs #11/#13/#38 (T-0905, T-0907 restored; financial.md; T-0901/T-0925 findings) and closed them; eval delta none.
- 2026-10-05 — Log frozen here (decision 0024, T-0033); later work: `git log --first-parent main` and the steward's daily summary.
- 2026-10-05 — Owner re-applied the T-0023 routines (sonnet hourly, opus every 2 h); T-0032: sonnet queue buffer (≥10 ready sonnet tasks; `make ready-tasks`, decision 0021).
